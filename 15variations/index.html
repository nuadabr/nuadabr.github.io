            <span>Hey! This is a <em>CDS2002</em> assignment. I had to choose a manifesto and explore typography with HTML/CSS with 15 variations with each level getting less restrictive. I chose <em>Obsessions</em> by Stefan Sagmeister, mostly because it relates to me a lot! Each level has a certain <b>rule</b> (apart from the assignment restrictions) which you might want to keep in mind if you're trying to find the next page. Have fun!</span>
