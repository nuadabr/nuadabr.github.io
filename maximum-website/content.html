                        <p>The Royal Rumble 2010. Triple H was number 8. H is the 8th letter of the alphabet, it was 8 years since the Royal Rumble was held in Atlanta, Georgia, and 8 years ago, Triple H won
                            the Rumble.</p>
                        <span class="fs-med">Fridge Brilliance - PG-Era**</span>
                        <p>The PG-era in general. Back when first enacted, they’d literally stop the match if someone was bleeding to patch them up and wrestlers would apologize immediately after shows for
                            using words like ass. Now that they’ve let up on these restrictions in 2011, it’s become shocking again when wrestlers say ass or douchebag (see CM Punk) and the few times when wrestlers bleed make huge impacts in storylines (see Cody Rhodes).</p>
                        <span class="fs-med">Fridge Brilliance - "Stone-Cold" Steve Austin***</span>
                        <p>Some people wonder why “Stone Cold” Steve Austin turned in the first place in 2001. However, the Shocking Swerve doesn’t seem so shocking you realize (A) Austin lost a grueling final
                            battle against Triple H, the man who had him run over by a car and took him out of action for nearly a year and (B) Vince McMahon appointing his then-wife Debra as the manager of
                            his WrestleMania opponent The Rock against any of their wishes, which resulted in Austin being unable to protect her from an Ankle Lock from Kurt Angle. Austin’s line of “I need to win this, Rock” was him crossing the Despair Event Horizon meaning, days away from WrestleMania and the most important match of his comeback from neck surgery, Austin looked
                            weak. Austin’s stare in his locker room shortly before his match taking place was him after making the deal with Vince McMahon.</p>
                        <p>Likewise, this can seen as the ultimate victory for Vince McMahon after being humiliated by Austin in two WrestleManias over the past three years. Vince’s appointment of Debra as The
                            Rock’s manager was a way to weaken Austin and play off his insecurities over not defeating Triple H. Since Vince couldn’t beat Austin, he made Austin join him.</p>
                        <p>Digging in deeper, Vince’s past relationship with The Rock comes into play. Rock was Vince’s hand-picked Corporate Champion, but ultimately failed to stop Austin at WrestleMania 15 and
                            Backlash 1999, thus getting him kicked out of the Corporation. This puts McMahon turning on Rock at the next WrestleMania in another perspective aside from Vince being reunited with his family: Vince could not trust The Rock to get the job done. As well, The Rock did something that Austin could not do: beat McMahon’s own son-in-law, Triple H; this arguably made Rocky a bigger threat to Vince than Austin was. This also explains why McMahon set Rock up with Debra knowing full well Austin would inevitably snap. With all that in mind,
                            Vince got the ultimate victory on The Rock as well: Vince’s new hand-picked Corporate Champion is the same man that The Rock has never defeated with gold on the line. This even
                            dates all the way back to December 1997 when Austin retained the Intercontinental Championship against The Rock. Sure enough, The Rock would fail to beat Stone Cold again the following night.</p>

                        <p>Claire is an example of Sir Not-Appearing-in-This-Trailer, as are the characters connected to the Daily Days. Why? Reporters don’t report on themselves, and the series is through the
                            lens of that paper’s reporting on the Flying Pussyfoot incident. The eventual reveal of why Jacuzzi, the most timid character in the whole series would have the most attention-drawing feature, his huge jagged sword tattoo. It seems especially incongruous when you see that the tattoo is being used to identify him on his wanted posters. </p>
                        <p>Turns out it’s a CMOH: Jacuzzi got it after his best friend and later girlfriend Nice scarred herself horribly after an explosives accident, so they could match and she wouldn’t
                            be alone in being stared at.</p>
                        <p>In the novels, the reason is different. The reason he gets a tattoo is because Nice’s eyesight became very damaged by the accident, so he got it so that she could always recognize him no matter what.</p>
                        <p> Isaac and Miria hatch a rather odd plot to steal an entire museum. It doesn’t quite work out, so they just steal the door to “keep people from entering.” Crazy? Maybe, until you realize that with the door stolen, the police would close the museum down for an investigation. So their plan WORKED, but maybe just not in the way they intended.</p>
                        <p>Also notable is that Isaac and Miria performed the post-episode trailers as if they were actually watching the show and guessing what would be in the next episode. Take into account that they’re immortals living within the Naritaverse, where Baccano is actually a television show by the time the events of the Durarara!! anime start (Baccano plays on the big screen TV in the middle of town in some shots). Isaac and Miria could very well have been watching themselves on television in-universe without actually breaking the Fourth Wall at all; just talking to each other about the episodes.</p>
                        <p>One of the points brought up against Czeslaw is the time he abandoned Mary in the closet on the train. What occurred to this troper when discussing it with a friend was that though he abandoned her, he apparently went out of the way to take her to an empty, secluded area of the train when he could have ditched her the minute they were out of her mother’s sight. Hiding her in the closet was a good idea, because if Mary hadn’t accidentally made noise, she most likely would have been safe there. After all, who would think to go far back into the train and check the closets for people hiding? It was her knocking over cleaning equipment that caught the attacker’s attention and put her in danger. </p>
                        <p>This might be supported by the fact that even eighty years later, he still remembers the time he spent with her fondly. Czeslaw was trying to keep her safe, even if he didn’t realize it!</p>
                        <p> When you only follow the anime, it seems strange that later on Claire introduces himself as formerly being Claire Stanfield and is no longer a conductor, until remembering that Dune of the Russo Family had red hair, was close to Claire’s height, stole a conductor’s uniform earlier and had his face completely smashed beyond recognition. Turns out the police pronounced Claire dead because Dune fit the description best.</p>
                        <p> Despite all common sense, Elmer being both an altruistic Anti-Nihilist and an emotionally hollow psychopath is not as entirely contradictory as it sounds once you realize that most psychopaths are incredibly apathetic utilitarians. Elmer’s just a rare one who practices what he preaches.</p>
                        <p>The awkward moment you realise the rail tracer - Claire Stanfield - has been in the opening credits all this time. </p>
                        <p> Not only that, he’s holding a bottle of wine. His assassin nickname is Vino.</p>

                        <p>Even as a casual Deadpool fan, I have to wonder exactly why he’s so bloody popular at the moment. So I looked at the state of the Marvel Universe at the moment, and it became painfully clear. In a Crapsack World where you can barely tell the heroes from the villains and don’t know who to cheer for, where Spider-Man made a a deal with the Devil and many important stories are indistinguishable from bad fanfic, Deadpool is different. He points out the absurdity, he’s just as confused about good and evil as the rest of us are. And most importantly, he’s actually funny, when damn near everyone else is painfully serious about wearing spandex and beating up other weirdos wearing spandex he’s at least trying to crack funny jokes. Deadpool has been a shining ray of light in the darkness of the Marvel U, as goofy and fun as the Silver Age without the preachy morality, and reminds us who we’re reading these damn things in the first place. - Sabre Justice</p>
                        <p>What’s very interesting is just how close this is to how he’s portrayed in both “Uncanny X-Force” and “Thunderbolts”; sure, he’s insane, but he’s shown that he’s a good man who, truthfully, just wants to do the right thing.</p>
                        <p>Stinkoman87 just wants to add something: he’s funny, but in a raunchy way, and uses guns. Deadpool is what would happen if someone made Spider-Man in the modern age. He also strikes a good balance between “Ax-Crazy murdering sociopath” and “Guy who honestly wants to do the right thing but keeps getting the Heel–Face Door-Slam”. Just bloody enough to be badass, just annoying enough to be hilarious, and just messed up enough to be sympathetic.</p>
                        <p>The point isn’t that Deadpool’s a Good Guy by a reasonable standard. The point is that he’s trying. A lot of heroes have an arc in their origin where they put on the cape, learn that with great power comes responsibility, etc. Deadpool started out on the other side and even when he fails (And he does. A lot.) he keeps trying. If Siren was the original impetus, trying to be worthy of her, Deadpool has gone way beyond trying to Get the Girl. There’s a *reason* he can still work with the Marvel heroes whereas the Punisher can’t. He’s trying.</p>
                        <p>Awwww, you guuuys~! You really mean that?</p>
                        <p>Enjoydamoment just wants to say yes we do Deadpool sir. You’re the most balanced when you’re unbalanced.</p>
                        <p>Death clearly seems to return our beloved Merc’s affections more than she does Thanos’s. Well, think about it: Thanos wants to destroy the universe, meaning no life. Death only exists because there is life. It’s symbiotic. Whereas Deadpool just runs around killing people, no large-scale stuff. Still giving more to Death without threatening her existence.</p>

                        <p>I got so much new respect for Slither when I realised that the main characters are all subversions of their traditional roles in horror. Including the villain. Especially the villain. -Whatever</p>
                        <p>Nathan Fillion once noted he loved Pardy for his very human, “What the fuck?” reaction early on, rather than instantly donning the boots of asskicking.</p>
                        <p>Fridge Brilliance: The only ones that survive are the ones willing to learn and adapt, in other words evolve, like Starla was teaching earlier in the film.</p>
                       <p> Fridge Horror: Just the ending and how the three survivors are going to explain a town full of dead bodies when it’s unlikely there’s any proof of alien slugs once the Grantmonster is killed.</p>
                        <p>First, there’s the fact that, if there are no signs of slugs, then it won’t be clear exactly how the three survivors managed to wipe out an entire town, especially with some of the dead being armed police officers (and with no obvious signs of violence on the bodies). In addition, there might be some signs that the alien slugs were in the brains of the victims before they died (especially since Kylie’s family were suffering seizures as the aliens entered their brain). And some of the corpses will look as if they were partially devoured, IMO, I don’t know if the authorities will believe the alien story, but they won’t believe that three people managed to kill off an entire town.</p>
                        <p>The fact that the parasite wasn’t evil per se, just doing what its’ natural life cycle is.</p>

                        <p>When naming your character, the game specifically asks you to “Name the fallen human”. Obviously this is referring to the child you control, and how they fell down the chasm in the game’s intro, right? Nope. The name you enter at the beginning of the game turns out to be the name of the First Child, who had passed away, or fallen due to an illness.</p>
                        <p>“Fallen” also relates to the whole Delta Rune prophecy mentioned further down the page. The child appears angelic, but is actually demonic, and they’re trying to end the world.</p>
                       <p> The angelic appearance and the ‘fallen’ nature of the First Child actually somewhat reflect Lucifer (aka Satan/The Devil/Beelzebub) from Christian mythology. He was an angel that rebelled and fell from heaven, similar to how the First Child (who, on the surface, would likely be seen as an outsider due to their sadistic mindset) literally fell from the surface. This is backed up by the fact that Lucifer is seen as a tempter and a manipulator, much in the same way that both Flowey and The Fallen Child use the promise of EXP and LV (more power in exchange for acts of evil) to tempt the player into bringing about the death and destruction they seek.
                        <p>This is reflected in their shirts as well. Both the First Child and Asriel wear green. Each have symbolized both hope, and Satan. The Fallen Child first symbolizes hope, then Satan in a Genocide Route. Asriel first symbolizes Satan, then hope.</p>
                       <p> When you first meet Toriel, she introduces herself by saying “greetings”. Who else introduces themself like that? Chara, of course!</p>
                        <p>The fact that the player character develops a separate, homicidal personality is actually even more of Undertale’s meta-commentary on games in general. Certain stereotypes aside, it’s likely a player who encounters the Fallen Child isn’t actually a killer in real life, or even wants to be; they only are killing everyone in-game just to see how deep the rabbit hole goes, or are probably just fanatical at Level Grinding. To them, the character they’re controlling is a different person. So, that’s what the game gives you; a Villain Protagonist completely at peace with the idea of killing every living thing in order for a player to see what happens. Chara even refers to themselves in the context of being a player character in a game, as a “demon” that is summoned when their name is called (i.e., when you name them at the beginning of any game) and claiming “Time after time, I will appear. And, with your help. We will eradicate the enemy and become strong. HP. ATK. DEF. GOLD. EXP. LV. Every time a number increases, that feeling... That’s me.” Hands up: Who here thinks such an individual would react badly to finally being told “no?” Karma can be a tough old broad, can’t she?</p>
                       <p> This could be taken a step further, when taking a certain theory into account. The separate character is the first fallen child (or their mindset, rather). Your character would never do this, but the original child, overtaken by grief and emotion, would.</p>
                       <p>All of the human SOULs have a certain color associated with them, and the player character’s SOUL is colored red. The PC is also the only human to survive their journey through the underground. When dealing with the light spectrum, red is the color with the longest wavelength—that is, to say, out of all the colors, red is the one that travels the farthest.</p>
