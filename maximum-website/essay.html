            <p>The webcomic XKCD perfectly illustrates the rabbit hole of the Internet known as TV Tropes. In 24 panels, Tab Explosion depicts a lone stick figure clicking over and over on a computer. The final
                panel shows the stick figure pleading for help “Can’t […] Stop […]”. The allure of this site,
                famous for its time-wasting potential among my peers, prompted my interest in examining the content
                further without the risk of being pulled into the black hole of popular culture references.</p>

            <p>TV Tropes defines itself as “a catalog of the tricks of the trade for writing fiction” (Home Page).
                The wiki began as a Buffy the Vampire Slayer discussion board, and the show, which relies heavily
                on tropes, to the point it makes self-referential jokes, was the natural starting point for
                connecting “devices and conventions that a writer can reasonably rely on as being present in the
                audience members’ minds and expectations” – the definition of “trope” (Home Page). TV Tropes
                eventually and naturally expanded to include other types of media.</p>

            <p>TV Tropes is a wiki; anyone who joins the site can edit the content within – a problem discussed
                later. The creators are eager to inform the visitor that this wiki is not like any other wiki he or
                she has visited before. In fact, you are encouraged not to look for citations and that this site is
                not Wikipedia but is instead a “fun, interesting and a cool place to sink hours of time”. (“There
                is no such thing as notability”). Because of their “fun” stance, and that it is “by, for and about
                fans”, if the trope fits, it stays in the Example portion of the trope description. But, the
                creators have drawn a line in the sand and refuse to have porn used as an example of a trope. This
                makes the site safe (but maybe not for all audiences) place to explore the vast connections of
                human creativity. They have also had issues with censorship, which will not be detailed here. For a
                more in-depth article about TV Tropes and censorship, see Aja Romano’s article from (2009), “TV
                Tropes deletes every rape trope; geek feminism wiki steps in” (Romano, 2009). This is something to
                keep in mind if you become a more serious user of the wiki. Related to site users, the content of
                TV Tropes is licensed with the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-ShareAlike and according

            <p>For the purposes of this review, only the basics of the site will be explained. Even after several
                visits, the wiki can seem overwhelming. The Administrivia page breaks down the “nitty gritty” so
                you can get a better sense of how to utilize the site. Most helpful for the new/basic users are the
                sections The Basic Stuff and TV Tropes Terminology, which also includes a handy glossary of the
                unique vocabulary of TV Tropers – people who contribute to the wiki. On the left-hand side of every
                page, you will find two different menus separated by advertisements. The top has three menus
                leading to the workings of the wiki, whereas the bottom menu is the main index which breaks down
                the tropes by narrative, genre, media, topical tropes (themes) and other categories. If you are not
                sure where to start, the indexes are a great place to begin.</p>

            <p>The tropes are usually named after a particular instance of the trope and, therefore,
                unconventional. This can be confusing for the uninitiated or those lacking knowledge of popular
                culture. Each trope has the same page structure: name of the trope, quote, picture, definition of
                the trope, related/subtropes and examples. Each trope is explained briefly at the top of the page,
                accompanied by a relevant quote and picture to further understanding. Below this section, each
                trope is also linked to similar tropes and then followed by the list of examples. Examples are
                divided into folders according to media it appears in. The trope examples are not listed in any
                particular order, which can be maddening. In most examples, there is usually another link or 2 or
                12 to other tropes.</p>

            <p>TV Tropes is an excellent example of linked data. Kurt Cagle’s blog post from 2009 about TV Tropes
                dives into the more nuanced aspects of the wiki’s relationship between tropes and linked data by
                describing how the site “represents all four principles” concerning the development of linked data
                “first articulated by Tim Berners-Lee” – the inventor of the Internet (Cagle (2009), TV Tropes is a
                true manifestation of the power of people linking ideas and information together.</p>

            <p>However, because of its free-wheeling nature, TV Tropes lacks accountability as a reliable resource.
                The creators admit: “Someone could add an example they made up and there is really nothing you
                could do to stop them. If the discussion finds an example to be purely fictional then it might get
                deleted, might” (“There is no such thing as notability”). So, if you’re using this beyond creative
                writing or learning facts to kill at Trivia Night, TV Tropes will need some fact-checking. And
                watch out for the creepers. Like all places on the Internet, there are trolls, but at least TV
                Tropers are good about avoiding spoilers – even for older content.</p>
